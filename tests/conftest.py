def client():

    Pytest fixture to provide a FastAPI TestClient instance for testing.

    This fixture sets up a TestClient instance using the main FastAPI app, and the scope is set to session,
    meaning it will be shared among all test functions in a session.

    Returns
    -------
    TestClient
        The FastAPI TestClient instance.

    Example
    -------
    Using the `client` fixture in a test function:
    ```python
    def test_example(client):
        response = client.get("/example")
        assert response.status_code == 200
        assert response.json() == {"message": "Example response"}
    ```
